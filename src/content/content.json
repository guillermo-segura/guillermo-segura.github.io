    "description": "I see myself as a calm and friendly person that always see the good intent in people. I don't like to jump into conclussions quickly and enjoy debating ideas in order to learn more about how others think. A bit of a shy extrovert, I'm comfortable in small groups but I get a bit nervous in front of big audiences. However, that hasn't stopped me from speaking in from of people when it was required.",
