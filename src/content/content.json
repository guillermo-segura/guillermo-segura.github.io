I don't like to jump into conclussions quickly and enjoy debating ideas in order to learn more about how others think. A bit of a shy extrovert, I'm comfortable in small groups but I can get nervous in front of bigger audiences; however, that's never stopped me from sharing my ideas. In a team environment, I enjoy helping others and making sure newcomers feel welcomed."
